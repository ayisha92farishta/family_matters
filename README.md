# Family Matters :family_man_woman_girl_boy:
Our team of three created this family organising application for our finals project at the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. 

This is a simple :electron:  React application created using the PERN stack. 
In other words ProsgreSQL(for database), Express(for routes), React(front end) and Node js(backend).

#### A little about the application

It is a simple family orgnization application to help families to stay organized and in-sync. An user can open an account and then add as many family members as possible under that account. These accounts shall sharre all the public informations amongst themselves. For example if one user adds an event, all the other users gets the update on their events calender. Same goes for lists , contacts , recipes etc. 

#### How to get it started 

- To begin fork and clone the repo in your machine. 
- Then from the terminal, cd into family_matters (or the folder you chose to put this in) and rin the commmand to download all the dependencies: 
 
```
 npm install
 ```
- We also have to install all the dependencies from inside the client and server folder. Instructions has been included below. 
- From here we have to fire up both the servers, react and express . Please make sure you are running node version 14 or above in order to successfully start both the servers.

#### React server 
- To get the react server started from the root directory, run the following commands  :

``` 
 cd client
 npm install
 npm start
```
- It should start the react server on your localhost 3000

#### Express server 
- Open a new tab in the terminal as both of these servers needs to run simultaneously.
- Then also from the root directory of the project folder run the following two commands, similar to what we did before :
 
```
 cd server
 npm install
 npm run local
 
```
It should start the experss server on your localhost 8080
