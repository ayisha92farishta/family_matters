# Family Matters :family_man_woman_girl_boy:
Our team of three created this family organising application for our finals project at the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. 

This is a simple :electron:  React application created using the PERN stack. 
In other words ProsgreSQL(for database), Express(for routes), React(front end) and Node js(backend).

#### How to get it started 

- To begin fork and clone the repo in your machine. 
- Then from the terminal, cd into family_matters (or the folder you chose to put this in). 
- From there we have to fire up both the servers, react and express . 

#### React server 
- To get the react server started from the root directory, run the following two commands  :

``` 
 cd client
 npm start
```
- It should start the react server on your localhost 3000

#### Express server 
- Open a new tab in the terminal as both of these servers needs to run simultaneously.
- Then also from the root directory of the project folder run the following two commands, similar to what we did before :
 
```
 cd server
 npm run local
 
```
It should start the experss server on your localhost 8080
 
#### Almost there... 

- Open the browser of your choice and got to **http://localhost:3000/** 
- You should be able to see the Sign in page
- Use the email 'amenzel@gmail.com' and password 'password' to get yourself logged in.
 
***And now you are good to go!***

Browse around this simple and yet usefull web application with plenty of features, such as events, lists, recipes, meal plans and etc. 

## Enjoy!
